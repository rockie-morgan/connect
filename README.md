This page describes Connect version 3.0. <a href="v2/README.md" target="_blank">Documentation for prior versions</a> is also available.

## New Features

- Simplified authentication and authorization. Client applications no longer need to maintain session tokens. Instead, applications identify themselves on every call to Connect with an Api-Key. Resources that require or support authorization based on user identity will accept OAuth2 access tokens in addition to the applicationâ€™s Api-Key.
- RESTful API for working with image and metadata resources leveraging HTTP verbs and returning standard HTTP Status codes.
- Simplified image download process by providing direct download links in search and metadata resources.
- <a href="https://connect.gettyimages.com/swagger" target="_blank">Interactive documentation</a> that is always up-to-date and in sync with our latest API functionality.

### Current Version

Connect is currently at version 3. Use the following base URI to access version 3 endpoints.

    https://connect.gettyimages.com/v3/

### Accept-Language

Connect returns results in many languages as specified in the Accept-Language header. Accept will return results in en-US (United States Engish) when the Accept-Language header is either unspecified or missing, specifies an invalid language code or an unsupported language code. A list of valid codes may be returing using the https://connect.gettyimages.com/v3/Countries endpoint.

     curl -i -H "Accept-Language:en-US" https://connect.gettyimages.com:443/v3/countrie

### Authentication

Connect requires all requests include an Api-Key to authenticate the client. Pass the Api-Key via the custom `Api-Key` HTTP Header.

    curl -i -H "Api-Key:j878g39yx378pa77djthzzpn" "https://connect.gettyimages.com/v3/images/452224426"

### Authorization

Connect allows, and in some cases requires, requests to include an access token to authorize elevated client privileges. Pass the access token via the standard `Authorization` HTTP header as type `Bearer`.

    curl -H "Api-Key:j878g39yx378pa77djthzzpn" -H "Authorization: Bearer {access_token}" https://connect.gettyimages.com/v3/downloads/83454811 -d "'" -L -o sample.jpg

Acquire an access token using one of the Connect [OAuth2 flows](oauth2.md#authorization-grant-flows). This example uses the OAuth2 [client credentials flow](oauth2.md#client-credentials-flow).

    curl -d 'grant_type=client_credentials&client_id=j878g39yx378pa77djthzzpn&client_secret=hZJS5A3GJpJvcGhaXwev3kwmq3DgtfcQmEuGbGruQBfsz' "https://connect.gettyimages.com/oauth2/token"
    
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
    Content-Length: 123
    
    {"access_token": "{token_string}", "token_type": "Bearer", "expires_in": "1800"}

If elevated client privilege is required but missing, Connect returns an authorization challenge in the response.

    HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
    WWW-Authenticate: Bearer realm="Download",error="invalid_token",error_description="The access token is missing"

### Request Throttling

Connect throttles client requests based on limits associated with the client's Api-Key. These limits can be viewed on your <a href="https://api.gettyimages.com/apps/mykeys" target="_blank">account page</a>. Click the **View Report** link on your key to get the current status of an Api-Key's limits.

There are two throttling limits and each has its own error message.

- Calls per second limit
    ```
    HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
    X-Error-Detail: Account Over Queries Per Second Limit

    {"message": "Account Over Queries Per Second Limit"}
    ```
- Calls per day limit
    ```
    HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
    X-Error-Detail: Account Over Rate Limit

    {"message": "Account Over Rate Limit"}
    ```

### Schema

All Connect access is over HTTPS. All data is sent and received as JSON.

    curl -i -H "Api-Key:j878g39yx378pa77djthzzpn" "https://connect.gettyimages.com/v3/search/images?phrase=books"

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK

    YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ

#### Summary, Detail, and Custom Representations

Some fields are computationally expensive for Connect to provide or require additional access privileges; and therefore, are not returned by default. Clients can specify additional fields be returned for a resource using the `fields` querystring parameter.

The default set of fields returned are the `summary_set`. Both of the following produce the same response.

    curl -i -H "Api-Key:j878g39yx378pa77djthzzpn" "https://connect.gettyimages.com/v3/images/452224426
    curl -i -H "Api-Key:j878g39yx378pa77djthzzpn" "https://connect.gettyimages.com/v3/images/452224426?fields=summary_set

Connect provides a `detail_set` specifier that will include additional fields.

    curl -i -H "Api-Key:j878g39yx378pa77djthzzpn" "https://connect.gettyimages.com/v3/images/452224426?fields=detail_set 

Alternately, clients can pass a comma delimited list of the specific fields they are interested in.

    curl -i -H "Api-Key:j878g39yx378pa77djthzzpn" "https://connect.gettyimages.com/v3/images/452224426?fields=id,title"

Some fields are in neither `summary_set` nor `detail_set` and must be explicitly specified.

    curl -i -H "Api-Key:j878g39yx378pa77djthzzpn" "https://connect.gettyimages.com/v3/images/452224426?fields=download_sizes"

Some fields require additional access priviledges and must be explicitly specified. In these cases clients must also provide an [access token](#authorization).

    curl -i -H "Api-Key:j878g39yx378pa77djthzzpn" -H "Authorization: Bearer {access_token}" "https://connect.gettyimages.com/v3/images/452224426?fields=downloads"

##### Download Sizes

Authorizing download of an image is computationally expensive. Therefore, clients that wish to receive details of available download sizes for images must explicitly specify that they want this information via the `fields` querystring parameter. The following tables show the available and allowed `fields` arguments for the endpoints that can return sizes and/or links to the downloadable image.

| `fields` argument   | description                                                   |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `downloads`         | returns downloadable sizes with hypermedia download links    |
| `download_sizes`    | returns downloadable sizes without hypermedia download links |
| `largest_downloads` | returns hypermedia download links to the largest size         |

| endpoints                    | `download_sizes` | `downloads` | `largest_downloads` |
|------------------------------|------------------|-------------|---------------------|
| `v3/search/images`           |                  |             |          X          |
| `v3/search/images/creative`  |                  |             |          X          |
| `v3/search/images/editorial` |                  |             |          X          |
| `v3/images`                  |        X         |       X     |          X          |

Note that clients using the `download_sizes` or `largest_downloads` arguments must also provide an [access token](#authorization).

##### Display Sizes

Display sizes can be retrieved by passing any of the following arguments in the `fields` parameter.

| `fields` argument | description           |
|-------------------|-----------------------|
| `comp`            | largest display size  |
| `preview`         | medium display size   |
| `thumb`           | smallest display size |

### Resources

Connect provides a RESTful API centered around resources, identified by a URI, that can be acted upon by the standard [HTTP verbs](#http-verbs). Descriptions of the Connect resources are provided on our <a href="https://connect.gettyimages.com/swagger" target="_blank">interactive documentation page</a>.

### HTTP Verbs

Connect strives to use appropriate HTTP verbs to perform actions on our [resources](#resources).

| verb  	| description                                           |
|--------| ------------------------------------------------------|
| GET 	  | use to retrieve a resources or collection             |
| POST	  | use to creating a resource or perform a custom action |
| PUT    | *unsupported at this time*                            |
| DELETE | *unsupported at this time*                            |

### Parameters

Some Connect endpoints take parameters specified as a segment in the path.

    curl -i -H "Api-Key:j878g39yx378pa77djthzzpn" "https://connect.gettyimages.com/v3/images/452224426"

Additional options can be specified as HTTP querystring parameters.

    curl -i -H "Api-Key:j878g39yx378pa77djthzzpn" "https://connect.gettyimages.com/v3/search/images?phrase=books"

Some resources allow filtering on their representations using the `fields` querystring parameter.

    curl -i -H "Api-Key:j878g39yx378pa77djthzzpn" "https://connect.gettyimages.com/v3/images/452224426?fields=id,title"

In the last example the response will contain only the fields `id` and `title`.

### Hypermedia

All resources may have one or more URI properties linking to other resources. These provide explicit URIs to additional resources, saving Connect clients from the need to construct the URIs on their own.

Here's an example of a search result providing a URI for downloading the image's largest size.

```json
"images": [
    {
        "id": "3231670",
         "largestDownloads": [
            {
                "product-type": "premiumaccess",
                "uri": "https://connect.gettyimages.com/Public/3.0/downloads/3231670"
            }
        ]
    }
]
```

A POST to the provided URI with a valid Api-Key and access token will download the image.

### HTTP Redirects

Connect uses HTTP redirection where appropriate. Clients should assume that any request may result in a redirection and be prepared to follow the redirect. Redirect responses will have a `Location` header field which contains the URI of the resource to which the client should repeat the requests. Connect currently uses <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.3.3" target="_blank">`302 Found`</a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.3.4" target="_blank">`303 See Other`</a> for redirects.

### Errors

There are the most common errors a client may receive when calling Connect.

1. Sending misspelled or improperly formatted request bodies or querystring parameters will result in a `400 Bad Request` response.
    ```http
    HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
    Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8

    {
        "message": "Invalid Request. Possible required parameter missing."
    }
    ```
1. Omitting, misspelling, or sending invalid Api-Key will result in a `403 Forbidden: Account Inactive` response.
    ```http
    HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
    Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8

    {
        "message": "Account Inactive"
    }
    ```
1. Submitting invalid image `id`'s will result in a `404 Not Found` response.
    ```http
    HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
    Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8

    {
        "code": "ImageNotFound",
        "message": "Image not found: 452O76944"
    }
    ```
1. Exceeding your Api-Key's [call per second throttle limit](#request-throttling) will result in a `403 Forbidden: Account Over Queries Per Second Limit` response.
    ```http
    HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
    X-Error-Detail:  Account Over Queries Per Second Limit
    Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8

    {
        "message": "Account Over Queries Per Second Limit"
    }
    ```
1. Exceeding your Api-Key's [call per day throttle limit](#request-throttling) will result in a `403 Forbidden: Account Over Rate Limit` response.
    ```http
    HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
    X-Error-Detail:  Account Over Rate Limit
    Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8

    {
        "message": "Account Over Rate Limit"
    }
    ```

### Pagination

Many Connect endpoints provide support for pagination of results. Pagination can be controlled by using the `page` and `page_size` querystring parameters. Default values will be used if none are provided.

- The `page` parameter defaults to 1.
- Search results default to a `page_size` of 30 items per `page`. The maximum `page_size` is 100.

This example demonstrates requesting the first page, containing 20 items, of search results.

    curl -H "Api-Key:j878g39yx378pa77djthzzpn" "https://connect.gettyimages.com/v3/search/images?phrase=dogs&page=1&page_size=20"

### Cross Origin Resource Sharing

We support cross origin resource sharing ([CORS](http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/)). All endpoints return the following header.

    Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
